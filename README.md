##### Demand and Supply of Infrequent Payments as a Commitment Device: Evidence From Kenya
##### Lorenzo Casaburi and Rocco Macchiavello
##### Replication 

The folder data contains all the data required to run the codes and produce the tables and figures. The folder do contains five do-files. The folder matlab_trader_IC contains one .m file. We describe each of these files below. The outputs of these codes are stored in the folder out. The folder out also contains a latex file, casaburi_macchiavello_figures_and_tables_AER, which compiles all the figures and tables in one pdf.
