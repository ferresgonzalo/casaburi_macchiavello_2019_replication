The folder data contains all the data required to run the codes and produce the tables and figures. The folder do contains seven do-files. The folder matlab_trader_IC contains one .m file. We describe each of these files below. The outputs of these codes are stored in the folder out. 


## do folder

# run.do
This code executes all the Stata do files in order. If you run this script, you do not need to run the other Stata do files individually.
If you want to run the Stata do files individually, follow the instructions at the beginning of each script, where you need to activate two lines of code that will set the directory path. 

# 0_install_packages
This code will install the Stata packages needed to run the other do files

# 1_analysis_baseline_survey_180719.do
This code produces Figure 1

# 2_analysis_demandexp_180719.do
This code produces Figures 2 and 3 and the first column in Table 1

# 3_analysis_supplyexp_180719.do
This code produces Figure 4, the second column in Table 1, and Table 2

# 4_analysis_priceexp_180719.do
This code produces Figure 6 and Table 3

# 5_analysis_other_settings_180719
This code produces Figure 7


## matlab_trader_IC folder

# trader_IC_180719.m
This code produces Figure 5
